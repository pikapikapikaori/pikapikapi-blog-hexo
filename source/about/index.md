## About Me

>Darkling I listen; and for many a time\
>I have been half in love with easeful Death,\
>Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme,\
>To take into the air my quiet breath;\
>Now more than ever seems it rich to die,\
>To cease upon the midnight with no pain,\
>While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad\
>In such an ecstasy!\
>Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain --\
>To thy high requiem become a sod.

Dream of becoming a person who holds love of wisdom and beauty.
